A full stack application using a variety of technologies. 
On the frontend, I am using React and Next JS to present content to users. Each service is created using Node and Express. Data for each service is held in either a Mongo database or Redis. 
The entire app is deployed and runs in Docker containers executed in a Kubernetes cluster. Finally, almost all of the code in this course is written with Typescript.
